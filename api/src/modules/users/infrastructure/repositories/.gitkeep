# Infrastructure Repository Implementations

This directory contains concrete repository implementations for the Users infrastructure layer.

Repository implementations should:
- Implement domain repository interfaces
- Handle data persistence and retrieval
- Use external data sources (databases, APIs)
- Map between domain entities and data models
- Be replaceable without affecting business logic
